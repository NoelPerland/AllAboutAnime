      Attack on Titan (Japanese: 進撃の巨人, Hepburn: Shingeki no Kyojin,
      lit. 'The Attack Titan') is a Japanese manga series written and
      illustrated by Hajime Isayama. It is set in a world where humanity is
      forced to live in cities surrounded by three enormous walls that protect
      them from gigantic man-eating humanoids referred to as Titans; the story
      follows Eren Yeager, who vows to exterminate the Titans after they bring
      about the destruction of his hometown and the death of his mother. Attack
      on Titan was serialized in Kodansha's monthly shōnen manga magazine
      Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from September 2009 to April 2021, with its
      chapters collected in 34 tankōbon volumes. An anime television series was
      produced by Wit Studio (seasons 1–3) and MAPPA (season 4). A 25-episode
      first season was broadcast from April to September 2013, followed by a
      12-episode second season broadcast from April to June 2017. A 22-episode
      third season was broadcast in two parts, with the first 12 episodes airing
      from July to October 2018 and the last 10 episodes airing from April to
      July 2019. A fourth and final season premiered in December 2020, airing 16
      episodes in its first part. A second part consisting of 12 episodes aired
